We find that public firms in external finance dependent industries spend more on research and development and generate a better patent portfolio than their private counterparts. However, public firms in internal finance dependent industries do not have a better innovation profile than private firms. The results are robust to various empirical strategies that address selection bias. The findings indicate that the influence of public listing on innovation depends on the need for external capital.},

The concentration of entrepreneurs in regions such as Silicon Valley has stimulated research and policy interest into the influence of peers, but the causal effect is hard to identify empirically. We exploit the exogenous assignment of students into business-school sections to identify the causal effect of entrepreneurial peers. We show that, in contrast to prior findings, a higher share of entrepreneurial peers decreases, rather than increases, entrepreneurship. The decrease is driven by a reduction in unsuccessful entrepreneurial ventures; the effect on successful ventures is significantly more positive.},

These measures have correlations of only 13 with the corresponding U.S. Census measures, which are based on all public and private firms in an industry. Also, only when U.S. Census measures are used is there evidence consistent with theoretical predictions that more-concentrated industries, which should be more oligopolistic, are populated by larger and fewer firms with higher price-cost margins. Further, the significant relations of Compustat-based industry concentration measures with the dependent variables of several important prior studies are not obtained when U.S. Census measures are used. One of the reasons for this occurrence is that Compustat-based measures proxy for industry decline. Overall, our results indicate that product markets research that uses Compustat-based industry concentration measures may lead to incorrect conclusions.},

And what concept of financial system - a focus on its size, including both intermediation and other auxiliary "non-intermediation" activities, or a focus on traditional intermediation activity - is relevant for its impact on real sector outcomes? This paper assesses the relationship between the size of the financial system and intermediation, on the one hand, and GDP per capita growth and growth volatility, on the other hand. Based on a sample of 77 countries for the period 1980-2007, we find that intermediation activities increase growth and reduce volatility in the long run. An expansion of the financial sectors along other dimensions has no long-run effect on real sector outcomes. Over shorter time horizons a large financial sector stimulates growth at the cost of higher volatility in high-income countries. Intermediation activities stabilize the economy in the medium run especially in low-income countries. As this is an initial exploration of the link between financial system indicators and growth and volatility, we focus on OLS regressions, leaving issues of endogeneity and omitted variable biases for future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The stock market is the archetypal example, which in most developed economies captures a lot of attention and resources.  Is the stock market just a side show or does it affect real economic activity?  In this article, we discuss the potential real effects of financial markets that stem from the informational role of market prices.  We review the theoretical literature and show that accounting for the feedback effect from market prices to the real economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process, the informativeness of the price, and speculators' trading behavior.  We make two main points.  First, we argue that a new definition of price efficiency is needed to account for the extent to which prices reflect information useful for the efficiency of real decisions (rather than the extent to which they forecast future cash flows).  Second, incorporating the feedback effect into models of financial markets can explain various market phenomena that otherwise seem puzzling.  Finally, we review empirical evidence on the real effects of secondary financial markets.},

Slow, but steady convergence towards the CAPM is discovered. The convergence process, however, halts before reaching the actual equilibrium. There is ample evidence that subjects gradually move up in mean-variance space, in accordance with the CAPM. Yet, adjustment stops as if the remaining trading time was insufficient to complete all the transactions that are needed to guarantee improvements in positions. We conjecture that this is due to subjects' hesitance in the face of market thinness. Because the convergence process halts, statistical tests reject the CAPM},

Cohort size fluctuations produce forecastable demand changes for age-sensitive sectors, such as toys, bicycles, beer, life insurance, and nursing homes. These demand changes are predictable once a specific cohort is born. We use lagged consumption and demographic data to forecast future consumption demand growth induced by changes in age structure. We find that demand forecasts predict profitability by industry. Moreover, forecast demand changes five to ten years in the future predict annual industry stock returns. One additional percentage point of annualized demand growth due to demographics predicts a 5 to 10 percentage point increase in annual abnormal industry stock returns. However, forecasted demand changes over shorter horizons do not predict stock returns. A trading strategy exploiting demographic information earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of approximately 6 percent. We present a model of inattention to information about the distant future that is consistent with the findings. We also discuss alternative explanations, including omitted risk-based factors.},

In these circumstances, it is argued, specific financial set-ups - such as 'market-based' vs. 'credit-based' mechanisms of allocation, control and ownership transfer - are likely to exert different influences on the rates and modes of industrial innovation. Relatedly, one suggests some hypotheses on the links between financial systems and features of industrial evolution, and some tentative taxonomies. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Industrial economics is a rich source of 'puzzles' for economic theory. One of them - certainly the most discussed - regards the co-existence of firms (and plants) of different sizes, displaying rather invariant skewed distributions. Other 'puzzles', however, concern the sectoral specificities in industrial structures, the persistence of asymmetric corporate performances and the dynamics of entry and exit. The paper reports some preliminary results on evolutionary modeling of the links between the microeconomics of innovation, the patterns of industrial change and some observable invariances in industrial structures. First, the paper reviews a few of these empirical regularities in structures and in the patterns of change. Second, the paper discusses the achievements and limits of interpretations of the evidence based on equilibrium theories. Finally, it presents a model where these regularities are explained as emergent properties deriving from non equilibrium interactions among technologically heterogeneous firms. Moreover, simulation exercises show that also the intersectoral variety in the observed industrial structures and dynamics can be interpreted on the grounds of underlying specificities in the processes of technological learning - which is called 'technological regimes' - and of the processes of market interactions - i.e. 'market regimes'. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The primary role of the capital market is allocation of ownership of the economy's capital stock. In general terms, the ideal is a market in which prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation: that is, a market in which firms can make production-investment decisions, and investors can choose among the securities that represent ownership of firms' activities under the assumption that security prices at any time "fully reflect" all available information. A market in which prices always "fully reflect" available information is called "efficient." This paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on the efficient markets model. After a discussion of the theory, empirical work concerned with the adjustment of security prices to three relevant information subsets is considered. First, weak form tests, in which the information set is just historical prices, are discussed. Then semi-strong form tests, in which the concern is whether prices efficiently adjust to other information that is obviously publicly available (e.g., announcements of annual earnings, stock splits, etc.) are considered. Finally, strong form tests concerned with whether given investors or groups have monopolistic access to any information relevant for price formation are reviewed. We shall conclude that, with but a few exceptions, the efficient markets model stands up well. Though we proceed from theory to empirical work, to keep the proper historical perspective we should note to a large extent the empirical work in this area preceded the development of the theory. The theory is presented first here in order to more easily judge which of the empirical results are most relevant from the viewpoint of the theory. The empirical work itself, however, will then be reviewed in more or less historical sequence. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

A discussion of two common approaches to predicting stock prices—the chartist (or technical) theories and the theory of fundamental (or intrinsic) value—allows the reader to put the theory of random walks into perspective. The theory of the market as efficient (at least semistrong efficient) and characterized as a random walk states that successive price changes in individual securities are independent and a series of stock price changes has no memory; thus, the past history of the series cannot be used to predict the future history. Empirical evidence indicates that, although price changes may not be strictly independent, the dependence is so slight that a simple buy-and-hold strategy beats any strategy based on mechanical trading rules. The implications of the market being a random walk are devastating for chartism. For fundamental value analysis, the im...},

Specifically, we find that mean reversion is faster when profitability is below its mean and when it is further from its mean in either direction. We also show that the mean reversion in profitability produces predictable variation in earnings.},

Building on the literatures on nonlinear dynamical systems and information complexity, we introduce a fractal approach as a useful lens to industry dynamism and a fresh alternative and complement to prevailing approaches. This differs conceptually from existing methods in highlighting nonlinearity and recognizing endogenous and stable sources of apparent unpredictability. Further, it uses the fractal dimension, a measure of the jaggedness in a time series, which offers several advantages over existing dispersion-based measures of unpredictability. We apply the fractal approach in an exploratory longitudinal study of the turbulent US network television industry and demonstrate its ability to uncover distinct aspects of industry dynamism. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

Firms with complex financial statements appear to use expectations management to beat expectations, but do not use earnings management. Corroborating these findings, we find analysts rely more on management guidance for more complex firms. Firms with complex financial statements are also more likely to have analysts exclude items from actual "street earnings," but tests suggest this strategy is not specifically used by complex firms to beat expectations.

Due to cognitive and strategic biases, investors are likely to pay more attention to novel and explorative patents rather than incremental and exploitative patents. We find that firms focusing on exploitation rather than exploration tend to generate superior subsequent operating performance. Analysts do not seem to detect this, as firms currently focused on exploitation tend to outperform the market's near-term earnings expectations. The market also seems unable to accurately incorporate innovation strategy information. We find that firms with exploitation strategies are undervalued relative to firms with exploration strategies and that this return differential is incremental to standard risk and innovation-based pricing factors examined in the prior literature. This result suggests a more nuanced view on whether stock market pressure hampers innovation.},

Twins pool their cash flows, so, with integrated markets, twin stocks should move together. However, the difference between the prices of twin stocks appears to be correlated with the markets on which they are traded most, i.e., a twin's relative price rises when the market on which it is traded relatively intensively rises. We examine several explanations of this phenomenon including: the discretionary use of dividend income by parent companies: differences in parent expenditures; voting rights; currency fluctuations; ex-dividend date timing issues; and tax-induced investor heterogeneity. Only the last hypothesis can explain some, but not all, of the empirical facts. We conjecture that: (a) country-specific sentiment shocks might affect share intensity, (b) investors are rational, but markets are segmented by frictions other than international transactions costs, such as agency problems. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We find that dominant companies operating in concentrated industries in Australia are able to generate significant risk-adjusted excess stock returns. Our results for Australian data are opposite to that found by Hou and Robinson (2006) for United States market data. Hou and Robinson reason that United States firms which operate in concentrated industries are insulated from competitive pressures, have lower levels of innovation (Arrow, 1962) and therefore experience lower profitability and stock returns. By contrast, the Australian data show a significant and positive relationship between concentration and innovation expenditure. Therefore, the excess stock returns of dominant companies in Australia are consistent with previous research linking innovation expenditure with excess stock returns. We hypothesize that the apparent contradiction of our results compared with Hou and Robinson (2006) for the United States market is resolved by an examination of the differences in size and competition in United States and Australian industries and the consequent differential ability of dominant companies in the two countries to generate monopoly rents and invest in 'Schumpeterian' (Schumpeter, 1942) innovation.},

The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that analysts exert too much pressure on managers to meet short-term goals, impeding firms' investment in long-term innovative projects.

This year-by-year set of product similarity measures allows us to generate a new set of industries in which firms can have their own distinct set of competitors. Our new sets of competitors explain specific discussion of high competition, rivals identified by managers as peer firms, and changes to industry competitors following exogenous industry shocks. We also find evidence that firm R{\&}D and advertising are associated with subsequent differentiation from competitors, consistent with theories of endogenous product differentiation.},

Using novel text-based analysis of firm 10-K product descriptions, we find three key results. (1) Firms are more likely to enter mergers with firms whose language describing their assets is similar. (2) Transactions in competitive product markets with similar acquirer and target firms experience increased stock returns and real longer-term gains in cash flows and higher growth in their product descriptions. (3) These gains are higher when the target is less similar to the acquirer's closest rivals, and when firms have the potential for unique products. Our findings are consistent with firms merging and buying assets to exploit synergies and to create new products to increase product differentiation.},

In the US, a significant number of industry returns, including retail, services, commercial real estate, metal, and petroleum, forecast the stock market by up to two months. Moreover, the propensity of an industry to predict the market is correlated with its propensity to forecast various indicators of economic activity. The eight largest non-US stock markets show remarkably similar patterns. These findings suggest that stock markets react with a delay to information contained in industry returns about their fundamentals and that information diffuses only gradually across markets. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We examine the impact of these differences upon financial research in several ways. First, we show that the classification of utilities, financial firms, and conglomerate acquisitions are affected by the choice of CRSP vs. Compustat SIC codes. Second, we show that industry classification matters in financial research by illustrating that size- and industry-matched comparisons are more powerful than pure size matches. Third, we test the specification and power of Compustat vs. CRSP classifications by simulating a typical financial experiment in which sample firms are matched to control firms by industry. We find that: i) Compustat matched samples are more powerful than CRSP matched samples in detecting abnormal performance; ii) nonparametric tests outperform parametric tests; and iii) four-digit SIC code matches are more powerful than two-digit SIC code matches. These results are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of extreme values, and hold for both NYSE/AMEX and Nasdaq firms},

Fama in the 1960s, this idea has been applied extensively to theoretical models and empirical studies of financial securities prices, generating considerable controversy as well as fundamental insights into the price-discovery process. The most enduring critique comes from psychologists and behavioural economists who argue that the EMH is based on counterfactual assumptions regarding human behaviour, that is, rationality. Recent advances in evolutionary psychology and the cognitive neurosciences may be able to reconcile the EMH with behavioural anomalies.},

The results from our time-series approach reinforce the importance of the skewness premium found in cross-sectional studies using lower-frequency data; and offer a potential resolution to sometimes conflicting results on the intertemporal risk-return relationship. We use a general utility specification, consistent with our pricing kernel, to evaluate the relative value of alternative risk premium models in an out-of-sample portfolio performance application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, 36{\%} of the growth recorded by conglomerate segments in growth industries comes from acquisitions, versus 9{\%} for single-segment firms. In growth industries, the effect of financial dependence on acquisitions and plant openings is mitigated for conglomerate firms. Plants acquired by conglomerate firms increase in productivity.

abstract = {Market share instability, during certain stages of the industry lifecycle, has become a stylized fact in the industrial organization literature. In the finance literature, volatility in the form of excess volatility, i.e. the much larger volatility of stock prices than dividends (although stock prices should in theory trace the present value of future dividends), has given rise to controversies regarding stock price determination (Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Shiller, 1989). Recent evolutionary models, both theoretical and empirical, have tied the presence of market share instability to industry specific variables, such as specific periods in the industry life-cycle and specific "technological regimes". The object of the paper is to explore whether there is a relationship between market share instability and stock price volatility and to what degree this relationship is connected to the concept of the industry life-cycle, and hence to industry specific factors. To do so, we explore the relationship in one particular industry, the US automobile industry. Since neither life-cycle nor finance theories attack this problem directly, we use insights from both approaches to build hypotheses which guide the data analysis. The empirical results confirm many of these hypotheses, suggesting that the degree of excess volatility is indeed partly affected by industry specific factors.},

In this article, we analyze how firm-level innovation affects (i) the likelihood of seeking external finance and (ii) the likelihood of obtaining it.

abstract = {The pace of industrial innovation and growth is shaped by many forces that interact in complicated ways. Profit-maximizing firms pursue new ideas to obtain market power, but the pursuit of the same goal by other means that even successful inventions art eventually superseded by others; this known as creative destruction. New ideas not only yield new goods but also enrich the stock of knowledge of society and its potential to produce new ideas. To a great extent this knowledge is non-excludable, making research and inventions the source of powerful spillovers. The extent of spillovers depends on the rate at which new ideas outdate old ones, that is on the endogenous technological obsolescence of ideas, and on the rate at which knowledge diffuses among inventors. In this paper we build a simple model that allows us to organize our search for the empirical strength of the concepts emphasized above. We then use data on patents and patent citations as empirical counterparts of new ideas and knowledge spillovers, respectively, to estimate the model parameters. We find estimates of the annual rate of creative destruction in the range of 2 to 7 percent for the decade of the 1970s, which rates for individual sectors as high as 25 percent. For technological obsolescence, we find an increase over the century from about 3 percent per year to about 12 percent per year in 1990, with a noticeable plateau in the l970s. We find the rate of diffusion of knowledge to be quite rapid, with the mean lag between I and 2 years. Lastly, we find that the potency of spillovers from old ideas to new knowledge generation (as evidenced by patent citation rate) has been declining over the century: the resulting decline in the effective public stock of knowledge available to new inventors is quite consistent with the observed decline in the average private productivity of research inputs (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

The degree of this shift varies across regions and is prominent in Europe and North America, while in Asia Pacific and Latin America, country effects still dominate.

abstract = {When measured over long periods of time, the correlation of countries' inflation‐adjusted per capita GDP growth and stock returns is negative. This result holds for both developed countries (for which the correlation coefficient is –0.39 using data from 1900–2011) and emerging markets (the correlation is –0.41 over the period 1988–2011). And this means that investors would have been better off investing in countries with lower per capita GDP growth than in countries experiencing the highest growth rates. This seems surprising since economic growth is generally assumed to be good for corporate profits. In attempting to explain this finding, the author begins by noting that economic growth can be achieved through increased inputs of capital and labor, which don't necessarily benefit the stockholders of existing companies. Growth also comes from technological advances, which do not necessarily lead to higher profits since competition among firms often results in the benefits accruing to consumers and workers. What's more, it's important to recognize that growth has both an expected and an unexpected component. And one explanation for the negative correlation between growth and stock returns is the tendency for investors to overpay for expected growth. But there is another - and in the author's view, a more important - part of the explanation. Along with the negative correlation between long‐run average stock returns and per capita growth rates, the author also reports a strong positive association between (per share) dividend growth rates and overall stock returns. Such an association is not surprising since unusual growth in dividends is a fairly reliable predictor of increases in future earnings. But another effect at work here is the role of dividends - and, in the U.S., stock repurchases too - in limiting what might be called the corporate “overinvestment problem,” the natural tendency of corporate managers to pursue growth, if necessary at the expense of profitability. One of the main messages of this article is that corporate growth adds value only when companies reinvest their earnings in projects that are expected to earn at least their cost of capital - while at the same time committing to return excess cash and capital to their shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.},

abstract = {This paper will develop the efficient markets model in Section I to clarify some theoretical questions that may arise in connection with the inequality (1) and some similar inequalities will be derived that put limits on the standard deviation of the innovation in price and the standard deviation of the change in price. The model is restated in innovation form which allows better understanding of the limits on stock price volatility imposed by the model. In particular, this will enable us to see (Section II) that the standard deviation of p is highest when information about dividends is revealed smoothly and that if information is revealed in big lumps occasionally the price series may have higher kurtosis (fatter tails) but will have lower variance. The notion expressed by some that earnings rather than dividend data should be used is discussed in Section III, and a way of assessing the importance of time variation in real discount rates is shown in Section IV. The inequalities are compared with the data in Section V. (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {The efficient markets hypothesis has been the central proposition in finance for nearly thirty years. It states that securities prices in financial markets must equal fundamental values, either because all investors are rational or because arbitrage eliminates pricing anomalies. This book describes an alternative approach to the study of financial markets: behavioral finance. This approach starts with an observation that the assumptions of investor rationality and perfect arbitrage are overwhelmingly contradicted by both psychological and institutional evidence. In actual financial markets, less than fully rational investors trade against arbitrageurs whose resources are limited by risk aversion, short horizons, and agency problems. The book presents models of such markets. These models explain the available financial data more accurately than the efficient markets hypothesis, and generate new predictions about security prices. By summarizing and expanding the research in behavioral finance, the book builds a new theoretical and empirical foundation for the economic analysis of real-world markets.},

abstract = {SAS PROC MIXED is a flexible program suitable for fitting multilevel models, hierarchical linear models, and individual growth models. Its position as an integrated program within the SAS statistical package makes it an ideal choice for empirical researchers and applied statisticians seeking to do data reduction, management, and analysis within a single statistical package. Because the program was developed from the perspective of a "mixed" statistical model with both random and fixed effects, its syntax and programming logic may appear unfamiliar to users in education and the social and behavioral sciences who tend to express these models as multilevel or hierarchical models. The purpose of this paper is to help users familiar with fitting multilevel models using other statistical packages (e.g., HLM, MLwiN, MIXREG) add SAS PROC MIXED to their array of analytic options. The paper is written as a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to fit the two most common multilevel models: (a) school effects models, designed for data on individuals nested within naturally occurring hierarchies (e.g., students within classes); and (b) individual growth models, designed for exploring longitudinal data (on individuals) over time. The conclusion discusses how these ideas can be extended straighforwardly to the case of three level models. An appendix presents general strategies for working with multilevel data in SAS and for creating data sets at several levels.},

@article{Statman2011,
abstract = {A belief that markets are efficient is blamed for instigating the crisis we are in and lulling us into complacency as the crisis was approaching. But the debate about the role of such belief in the crisis is unfocused for two reasons. First, a lack of a common definition of market efficiency precludes a common language. Second, efficient markets are conflated with free markets.  The ambitious definition of efficient markets is their definition as rational markets, where security prices always equal intrinsic values. The modest definition of efficient markets is their definition as unbeatable markets. Bubbles cannot occur in rational markets but they can occur in unbeatable markets. I argue that a belief in market efficiency cannot bear responsibility for our crisis since most investors do not believe that markets are either rational or unbeatable.   Free markets are markets where government puts little or no imprint on the financial behavior of individuals and organizations and on markets through regulations and direct intervention. Many advocates of free markets believe that such markets are also more efficient than markets which are not as free. But free markets are distinct from efficient markets. Highly regulated markets can be no less efficient in the sense of rational markets or unbeatable markets than lightly regulated markets. I argue that a belief that free markets are always superior to regulated markets and lightly regulated markets are always superior to heavily regulated markets does bear some responsibility for our crisis. Regulations that would have limited the types of mortgages offered to homeowners would have helped stem the crisis or mitigate it. So would have limits on the degree of leverage employed by banks and homeowners alike.  Yet not all regulations and government interventions bring unmitigated benefits. We have no precise measures by which we might distinguish real bubbles from illusory ones. Governments which aim to pop real bubbles run the risk of plunging us into recessions by popping illusory ones. While high P/E ratios and similar measures might alert us to the presence of real bubbles, they are far from precise. The challenge we face is the challenge of seeing an opaque future as clearly as possible, knowing not only that foresight is not as clear as hindsight but also that we would be judged in the future as if it is.},

abstract = {Correlation is the common indicator for the benefits of diversification, but it is not a good indicator for two reasons. First, the benefits of diversification depend not only on the correlation between returns, but also on the standard deviation of returns. Second, correlation does not provide an intuitive measure of the benefits of diversification. Return gaps are better indicators. A return gap is the difference in return between two assets or two portfolios. For example, as the authors show, the estimated 12-month return gap between the S{\&}P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index from February 2002 to January 2007 was 8.90{\%}.This return gap implied that investors who concentrated their portfolios in one index or the other should have expected to lead or lag investors who diversified between the two in equal proportions by 4.45{\%}.The realized 12-month return gaps ranged from 0.1{\%} to 28.7{\%}. It is difficult to intuitively deduce these figures from the relatively high 0.82 correlation between the two indices. Likewise, it is difficult to intuitively deduce from the relatively high 0.86 correlation between the S{\&}P 500 and EAFE indices that, over this same period, their estimated 12-month return gap was 6.86{\%} and realized 12-month return gaps ranged from 1.8{\%} to 23.0{\%}. Moreover, the figures belie any claim that these assets' risk-reduction benefits have largely vanished.},

abstract = {The four fluorescent derivatives of TPA—dansylaza‐TPA, NBDaza‐TPA, and (N)‐and (P)‐dansylamino‐TPA—were synthesized and examined for their ability to induce differentiation in human promyelocytic leukemic HL60 cells. At a concentration of 20 nM, all the derivatives inhibited proliferation and induced 60–80{\%} of the cells to differentiate into macrophage‐like cells. Removal of dansylaza‐TPA from the medium after 5 h did not arrest adherence or the expression of nonspecific esterase activity. However, upon removal of any of the other three compounds after 5 h, HL60 cells became nonadherent and expressed low nonspecific esterase activity after additional culture. To investigate the relationship between protein kinase C (PKC) activation and cell maturation, PKC activity and translocation were measured after 0.5, 5, 24, and 48 h of treatment with each compound. Cells induced to differentiate by dansylaza‐TPA or (N)‐ or (P)‐dansylamino‐TPA exhibited enhanced PKC activity, 50–80{\%} of which was located in the particulate fraction. In cells that differentiated with NBDaza‐TPA, 65–70{\%} of PKC activity remained in the cytosol. After removal of the TPA derivatives, all cells exhibited PKC activity in the cytosol. These results indicate that the fluorescent derivatives are as potent as TPA in inducing HL60 cell differentiation. However, in the case of NBDaza‐TPA and (N)‐ or (P)‐dansylamino‐TPA, their continuous presence in the culture medium was required for the recruitment of cells to differentiate. Consequently, it is suggested that activation and translocation of PKC are among the early biochemical events that trigger HL60 cell differentiation. Nevertheless, these two events alone are not sufficient to induce differentiation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1989 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

Moreover, a significant number of industry returns predict the volatility of the SMB and HML factors by up to two or three months.

abstract = {Motor and sensory cortical tongue representations were examined in 40 patients with intractable seizures who underwent chronic subdural electrode grid implantation. Tongue responses were observed in a wide area 4.5 cm anterior and 3 cm posterior to the central sulcus. The distribution of the responses was not influenced by whether the responses were unilateral or bilateral. In patients with fronto-parietal lesions, the tongue motor area was located significantly more superior to the Sylvian fissure and more anterior to the central sulcus than was the tongue motor area of patients without organic lesion. Both motor and sensory responses were found outside of the classic precentral or postcentral area on the lateral surface of the cortex. Motor responses ('parietal motor responses') could occur posterior to the central sulcus and, rarely, sensory responses ('frontal sensory responses') were identified anterior to the central sulcus. These paradoxical parietal motor and frontal sensory responses were seen in 17 out of 40 (42.5 {\%}) patients. Nine of these 17 patients had no organic brain lesion on MRI. Clinical factors, such as patient's age, duration of seizures and cognitive functions (IQ, word fluency score), did not influence the frequency of the paradoxical responses. However, patients with brain lesions showed a tendency to have associated paradoxical responses (P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, paradoxical responses are not uncommon in epilepsy patients, particularly in those with organic lesions. The physiological and clinical implications of the paradoxical responses are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Mathematical descriptions of financial markets with respect to the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and fractal finance are now equally robust but EMH still dominates. EMH and other current paradigms are extended to accommodate situations having higher information complexity and interactions coupled with positive feedback. The "herding behavior" literature in finance marks a significant recognition that interdependent trader behavior may result in deviation from normal distribution of returns, as does "chartist" trading. Further legitimization of the separate-but-equal status of EMH and fractal finance is pursued. Research on the nonlinear models giving theoretical underpinning to equations representing mirror markets as complex dynamical systems is encouraged. Why some herdingand chartist-behaviors scale up and then die off whereas others result in significant crashes is explained. The buildup to the 2007 liquidity crisis offers an example of nonlinear scale-free dynamics. Concepts from complexity science, econophysics, and scale-free theory are used to offer further explanation to physicists' mathematical treatments. {\textcopyright} The Institute of Behavioral Finance.},
